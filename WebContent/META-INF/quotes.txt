I think you ought to know I’m feeling very depressed.
It won’t work, I have an exceptionally large mind.
I have a million ideas. They all point to certain death.
Pardon me for breathing, which I never do anyway so I don’t know why I bother to say it.
Oh God, I’m so depressed.
Life! Don’t talk to me about life.
I could calculate your chance of survival, but you won’t like it.
My capacity for happiness, you could fit into a matchbox without taking out the matches first.
Funny how just when you think life can’t possibly get any worse it suddenly does.
I’d give you advice, but you wouldn’t listen. No one ever does.
I think you ought to know I’m feeling very depressed.
Not that anyone cares what I say, but the Restaurant is on the other end of the universe.
Life. Loathe it or ignore it. You can’t like it.
Do you want me to sit in a corner and rust, or just fall apart where I’m standing?
It’s the people you meet in this job that really get you down.
I’ve been talking to the main computer. It hates me.
This is the sort of thing you lifeforms enjoy, is it?
Don’t pretend you want to talk to me, I know you hate me.
Well I wish you’d just tell me rather than try to engage my enthusiasm.
It gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level.
I won’t enjoy it.
It amazes me how you manage to live in anything that small.
Sounds awful.
I didn't ask to be made.
